# Earnings Call Toolkit

The purpose of this library is to provide tools that will allow you to analyze prices around earnings dates (before, after, during) and judge and visualize the data. It comes with strategies that I am using to make my own market decisions.

Currently there are two strategies, one of them is for analyzing intraday earnings call data for after market earnings calls, and one of them is for analyzing earnings calls on a daily time frame and that data is used to get an overview of past earnings calls data for a particular symbol. 

Current Stage: Beta
